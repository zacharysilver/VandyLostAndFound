# VandyLostAndFound

We are building a Lost-And-Found Web Application which makes reporting and finding lost
items easier and faster while keeping private information secure. Our client is the student body
and staff at Vanderbilt University who need an efficient way to manage misplaced items on
campus. The users of our platform can share details about lost (or found) items, upload
pictures, and connect with each other to resolve cases.

We will use the MERN stack
